Sample App for Android Developer Coding Test
============================================

I've created a public repository in Github and can clone the master branch with "Clone with HTTPS".
This application includes 3 screens (start, shoe list and shoe details).
Shoe list screen displays the list of shoes filtered by brand.
In detail screen, user can see details of each shoe, choose different sizes and can also see full description and free delivery with animation.
These screens get data from REST Api generated using Firebase Realtime Database.
